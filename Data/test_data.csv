A proper and divinely appointed deputy only can guide people and connect them with God. The divine delegation is a precondition for a genuine deputy.

There are, unfortunately, many who come from the household of His Holiness GoharShahi and they are actively deceiving people under the label of Holy Blood Line (آل).

"Two women took kids to a mosque and filmed themselves deriding the ‘illegal takeover’ by Muslims.

Two Arizona women have been arrested and charged with burglary after they went to a mosque — with three children in tow — and recorded themselves mocking the Muslim faith.

The incident, which happened earlier this month, comes at a time of heightening anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States.

Tahnee Gonzales and Elizabeth Dauenhauer went to the Islamic Community Center in Tempe, Ariz., to, as Gonzales claimed, “expose” the evils of sharia law and the “invasion and illegal takeover” by Muslims. Gonzales posted a Facebook Live video of the duo and the children walking into the outdoor playground of the mosque. They grabbed brochures and fliers about events, prayer announcements, classes and services and made disparaging comments about Muslims while Gonzales kept live-streaming.

“Oh, look at that! Food stamps, huh. Oh, look at that, double your food stamps,” Gonzales said, appearing to read a flier posted on a bulletin board. “You’re already getting free tax money. Why don’t you double it? All on the American hard-earned taxpayer.”

“Look at this, you guys,” she added, talking to her Facebook Live viewers.

Walking over to another bulletin board, the women saw an announcement about tax assistance, which prompted Gonzales to say: “What do they work and do? They don’t even work.”

At one point, Gonzales can be heard telling one of the children to not touch the outdoor slide, suggesting it’s covered in “germs.”

“This is the infiltration of the Arabic Muslim, coming in and destroying America,” Gonzales told her Facebook Live viewers. “The Muslims are nothing but evil Satan worshipers. … Pedophilia runs deep in the Muslim community.”

At one point, Dauenhauer marveled at their haul: “We have so much literature.” To which Gonzales said, “Yep, we’re gonna expose this.”

He wanted to build Trump’s border wall. He was just charged in the bombing of a Minnesota mosque.

Detective Lily Duran, spokeswoman for the Tempe Police Department, said the women were arrested Thursday and charged with burglary, a felony. She said “an enhancement of hate crime will be considered” for their sentencing.
