Indonesian police charged a Christian man with blasphemy on Dec. 15 for allegedly insulting Islam by comparing the Prophet Muhammad with an alleged child rapist in a social media post.

Joseph Suryadi, 39, from Tangerang, a city near Jakarta, is accused of uploading a caricature of the prophet on Twitter and comparing him with an Islamic boarding school owner called Herry Wirawan.

Wirawan, from Bandung in West Java, is accused of raping 13 girls at his boarding school.


The caricature shows a man with a woman in a hijab along with a message saying that the age of Aisah, the Prophet Muhammad’s wife, was young when she was married to the prophet and that his desire for the young woman was like what Wirawan had for his victims.

Police arrested Suryadi after receiving more than 7,000 complaints from Indonesian Muslims. He faces up to five years in prison if found guilty of blasphemy.

Jakarta police spokesman Endra Zulpan said Suryadi had denied uploading the caricature and said it happened after he discovered his mobile phone had gone missing.

Father Antonius Benny Susetyo, a member of a presidential unit promoting communal tolerance, told UCA News that Suryadi will have committed a grave offense if it’s proved he did upload the social media post.

“The government wants the law to protect all people from hatred related to religion and race. We believe the police will resolve it professionally,” he said.

"Mahomet (French: Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète, literally ""Fanaticism, or Mahomet the Prophet"") is a five-act tragedy written in 1736 by French playwright and philosopher Voltaire. It made its debut performance in Lille on 25 April 1741. The play is a study of religious fanaticism and self-serving manipulation based on an episode in the traditional biography of Muhammad in which he orders the murder of his critics. Voltaire described the play as ""written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect to whom could I with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet"".[34]

In a letter to Frederick II of Prussia in 1740 Voltaire ascribes to Muhammad a brutality that ""is assuredly nothing any man can excuse"" and suggests that his following stems from superstition and lack of Enlightenment.[35] He wanted to portray Muhammad as ""Tartuffe with a sword in his hand.""[36][37]

According to Malise Ruthven, Voltaire's view became more positive as he learned more about Islam.[38] As a result, his book, Fanaticism (Mohammad the Prophet), inspired Goethe, who was attracted to Islam, to write a drama on this theme, though completed only the poem Mahomets-Gesang (""Mahomet's Singing"").[a]

But at Medina he seems to have cast off all shame; and the incidents connected with his marital relations, more especially the story of his marriage with Zainab the wife of his adopted son Zaid, and his connexion with Mary the Coptic slave-girl, are sufficient proof of his unbridled licentiousness and of his daring impiety in venturing to ascribe to GOD Most High the verses which he composed to sanction such conduct.[170]

"PKB Rebukes Minister Yaqut for Comparing Azan to Dog Barking.

The National Awakening Party (PKB) sharply rebuked its cadre who is also Minister of Religious Affairs, Yaqut Cholil Qoumas, after comparing the sound of the Islamic call to prayer or azan to the barking of dogs. The party’s deputy chair Jazilul Fawaid said Yaqut had caused public uproar and sparked controversy.

""Manage productive things for the benefit of the people,"" Jazilul Fawaid, better known as Gus Jazil, asked the minister in a written statement, Thursday, Feb. 24.

Jazilul claimed that the party received a lot of complaints about Yaqut's statement which was considered very inappropriate and some even deemed it blasphemous. He also mentioned that according to the Islamic jurisprudence or fiqh, answering the call to prayer for Muslims is obligatory.


“Astaghfirullah! We respectfully recommend the Minister rectify and admit the error of his analogy,” said Jazilul who is also Deputy Speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).

Instead of causing a fuss in the public, he asked Yaqut Cholil Qoumas to focus on helping President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo to carry out more productive jobs in the government, especially in matters of religion. “Pak Jokowi repeatedly reminded his cabinet to focus on working, rather than making an uproar,” Jazilul emphasized.

In his authoritative work of law the Mishneh Torah (Hilkhot Melakhim 11:10–12), Maimonides indicated that nevertheless Muhammad was part of God's plan of preparing the world for the coming of the Jewish Messiah: ""All those words of Jesus of Nazareth and of this Ishmaelite [i.e., Muhammad] who arose after him are only to make straight the path for the messianic king and to prepare the whole world to serve the Lord together. As it is said: 'For then I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech so that all of them shall call on the name of the Lord and serve him with one accord' (Zephaniah 3:9).""[5]

"Thomas Aquinas
Thomas Aquinas was highly critical of Muhammad's character and ethics, claiming that his teachings were largely in conformity to his immoral lifestyle. He wrote in Summa Contra Gentiles:

""""[Muhammad] seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh goads us. His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected, he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the natural ability of anyone with a very modest wisdom... Nor do divine pronouncements on the part of preceding prophets offer him any witness. On the contrary, he perverts almost all the testimonies of the Old and New Testaments by making them into fabrications of his own, as can be seen by anyone who examines his law. It was, therefore, a shrewd decision on his part to forbid his followers to read the Old and New Testaments, lest these books convict him of falsity. It is thus clear that those who place any faith in his words believe foolishly.

"See for example William Muir, who says ""Shortly after the death of Khadîja, the Prophet married again; but it was not till the mature age of fifty-four that he made the dangerous trial of polygamy, by taking Ayesha, yet a child, as the rival of Sauda. Once the natural limits of restraint were overpassed, Mahomet fell an easy prey to his strong passion for the sex. In his fifty-sixth year he married Haphsa; and the following year, in two succeeding months, Zeinab bint Khozeima, and Omm Salma. But his desires were not to be satisfied by the range of a harem already greater than was permitted to any of his followers; rather, as age advanced, they were stimulated to seek for new and varied indulgence. A few months after his nuptials with Zeinab and Omm Salma, the charms of a second Zeinab were by accident discovered too fully before the Prophet's admiring gaze. She was the wife of Zeid, his adopted son and bosom friend; but he was unable to smother the flame she had kindled in his breast; and, by divine command she was taken to his bed. In the same year he married a seventh wife, and also a concubine. And at last, when he was full threescore years of age, no fewer than three new wives, besides Mary the Coptic slave, were within the space of seven months added to his already well filled harem. The bare recital of these facts may justify the saying of Ibn Abbâs,—""Verily the chiefest among the Moslems (meaning Mahomet) was the foremost of them in his passion for women;""—a fatal example imitated too readily by his followers, who adopt the Prince of Medîna, rather than the Prophet of Mecca, for their pattern.""

"CASTRO VALLEY, Calif. -- Police say a woman harassed and insulted a group of Muslims praying at a California park Sunday, before throwing a coffee at one man who was recording the incident with his cell phone, reports CBS San Francisco.The group said they gather weekly for volleyball and prayer at Lake Chabot Regional Park, near San Francisco. On Sunday, a woman, identified as Denise Slader, encountered the men around 3 p.m. and began insulting the Islamic faith and accusing the group of being terrorists. Slader is an employee of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to parks spokesperson Carolyn Jones.

Rasheed Albeshari recorded Slader and posted the video to Facebook.

""The people you tortured are going to be in eternity and heaven. You are very deceived by Satan. Your mind has been taken over, brainwashed and you have nothing but hate,"" Slader was recorded saying.

Albeshari told the Bay Area News Group that he and his friends told Slader they believe ""in Jesus, we respect Jesus. But she came back and told us Allah is Satan and that Muslims were all trying to destroy everything nice. That's when I started videotaping.""

""This woman came from nowhere,"" Albeshari told CBS San Francisco on Wednesday. ""She was yelling, 'Allah is Satan!' 'The Koran is evil!' and 'You are a bunch of brainwashed murderers!'""

A park ranger attempted to intervene and said Slader was behaving inappropriately.

Slader responded: ""It is inappropriate, you're right, for somebody to tape record me.""

Albeshari then says, ""this lady is talking about my God,"" before Slader can be seen approaching the camera. Police said Slader hit Albeshari with an umbrella and tossed her coffee at him.

Slader was not arrested, but police wrote a report recommending that the Alameda County District Attorney charge Slader with misdemeanor battery. The Los Angeles Times reports that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is investigating whether Slader violated any agency personnel policies.

Albeshari, an American citizen, told CBS San Francisco that he used to live Yemen, but moved back to California's Bay Area because of how tolerant the people were.

""Sometime when I watch the news, I see these things -- things of hate. But I never thought they would happen to me. Not in the Bay Area,"" Albeshari said. He said he's been comforted by an outpouring of support on Facebook, where video of the incident has been viewed more than 150,000 times.

"On 11 June 2007, Vilks was invited to participate in an art exhibition on the theme ""The Dog in Art"" (Swedish: Hunden i konsten) that was to be held in the small town of Tällerud in Värmland. Vilks submitted three pen and ink drawings on A4 paper depicting Muhammad as a roundabout dog. At this time, Vilks was already participating with drawings of Muhammad in another exhibition in Vestfossen, Norway, on the theme ""Oh, My God"". Vilks, who is a known proponent of institutional art, has stated that his original intention with the drawings was to ""examine the political correctness within the boundaries of the art community"".[9] According to Vilks, the art and culture communities in Sweden repeatedly criticize the United States and Israel, whereas Muslim values are rarely even questioned.[10]

On 20 July, the day before the opening of the exhibition in Tällerud, the organizers decided to withdraw Vilks's drawings from the exhibition due to security concerns and fear of violence from Islamic extremists (see Islam and blasphemy and Islam and animals). Märta Wennerström, the exhibition's organizer, said that at first she ""didn't realize the gravity of the situation"" and that she made the decision to remove the drawings after consulting Swedish government agencies and private persons.[11][12]

Following the first refusal to publish the drawings, Vilks submitted his drawings to the Gerlesborg School of Fine Art in Bohuslän (where he is a frequent lecturer) for a special teachers' exhibition that was going to be opened on 18 August. On 13 August, however, the school announced that they also had decided to reject the drawings due to security concerns.[13] This second rejection started an intense debate in the Swedish media about self-censorship and freedom of expression.

On 18 August, the Örebro-based regional newspaper Nerikes Allehanda published one of Vilks's drawings in an editorial on freedom of expression. The editorial defended ""Muslims' right to freedom of religion"" but also said it must be permitted to ""ridicule Islam's most foremost symbols — just like all other religions' symbols.""[1] On the same day, the drawings were also published in several other Swedish newspapers including Aftonbladet, Dagens Nyheter, Expressen and Upsala Nya Tidning.

"Satanic verses
Main article: Satanic Verses
Some criticism of the Quran has revolved around two verses known as the ""Satanic Verses"". Some early Islamic histories recount that as Muhammad was reciting Sūra Al-Najm (Q.53), as revealed to him by the angel Gabriel, Satan deceived him to utter the following lines after verses 19 and 20: ""Have you thought of Al-lāt and al-'Uzzā and Manāt the third, the other; These are the exalted Gharaniq, whose intercession is hoped for."" The Allāt, al-'Uzzā and Manāt were three goddesses worshiped by the Meccans. These histories then say that these 'Satanic Verses' were repudiated shortly afterward by Muhammad at the behest of Gabriel.[126]

There are numerous accounts reporting the alleged incident, which differ in the construction and detail of the narrative, but they may be broadly collated to produce a basic account.[127]

The different versions of the story are all traceable to one single narrator Muhammad ibn Ka'b, who was two generations removed from biographer Ibn Ishaq.[128] In its essential form, the story reports that Muhammad longed to convert his kinsmen and neighbors of Mecca to Islam. As he was reciting Sūra an-Najm,[129] considered a revelation by the angel Gabriel, Satan tempted him to utter the following lines after verses 19 and 20:

Have ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-'Uzzá
and Manāt, the third, the other?
These are the exalted gharāniq, whose intercession is hoped for.

Allāt, al-'Uzzā and Manāt were three goddesses worshipped by the Meccans. Discerning the meaning of ""gharāniq"" is difficult, as it is a hapax legomenon (i.e. used only once in the text). Commentators wrote that it meant the cranes. The Arabic word does generally mean a ""crane"" – appearing in the singular as ghirnīq, ghurnūq, ghirnawq and ghurnayq, and the word has cousin forms in other words for birds, including ""raven, crow"" and ""eagle"".[130]

The subtext to the event is that Muhammad was backing away from his otherwise uncompromising monotheism by saying that these goddesses were real and their intercession effective. The Meccans were overjoyed to hear this and joined Muhammad in ritual prostration at the end of the sūrah. The Meccan refugees who had fled to Abyssinia heard of the end of persecution and started to return home. Islamic tradition holds that Gabriel chastised Muhammad for adulterating the revelation, at which point [Quran 22:52] is revealed to comfort him,

Never sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited (the message) Satan proposed (opposition) in respect of that which he recited thereof. But Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth. Then Allah establisheth His revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise.

Muhammad took back his words and the persecution of the Meccans resumed. Verses 53:21-23 were given, in which the goddesses are belittled. The passage in question, from 53:19, reads:

Have ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza


And Manat, the third, the other?
Are yours the males and His the females?
That indeed were an unfair division!


They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which Allah hath revealed no warrant. They follow but a guess and that which (they) themselves desire. And now the guidance from their Lord hath come unto them.

The incident of the Satanic Verses is put forward by some critics as evidence of the Quran's origins as a human work of Muhammad.

"France's Macron: I won't condemn cartoons of Prophet Mohammad
By Reuters Staff




BEIRUT (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday it was not his place to pass judgment on the decision by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to re-publish cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, saying France has freedom of expression.

But Macron, speaking on a visit to Lebanon, said it was incumbent on French citizens to show civility and respect for each other, and avoid a “dialogue of hate.”

The magazine re-published the cartoons on the eve of a trial in Paris of alleged accomplices in a 2015 attack on the magazine’s offices by Islamist militant gunmen in which 12 people were killed.

When they were first published by Charlie Hebdo and other publications, the cartoons unleashed a wave of anger in the Muslim world. For Muslims, any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.

Before the attack on Charlie Hebdo’s offices, militants online had warned the magazine would pay for publishing the cartoons.

“It’s never the place of a president of the Republic to pass judgment on the editorial choice of a journalist or newsroom, never. Because we have freedom of the press,” Macron said.

"Modern scholars, such as Sprenger, Noldeke, Weil, Muir, Koelle, Grimme, Margoliouth, give us a more correct and unbiased estimate of Mohammed's life and character, and substantially agree as to his motives, prophetic call, personal qualifications, and sincerity. The various estimates of several recent critics have been ably collected and summarized by Zwemer, in his ""Islam, a Challenge to Faith"" (New York, 1907). According to Sir William Muir, Marcus Dods, and some others, Mohammed was at first sincere, but later, carried away by success, he practised deception wherever it would gain his end. Koelle ""finds the key to the first period of Mohammed's life in Khadija, his first wife"", after whose death he became a prey to his evil passions. Sprenger attributes the alleged revelations to epileptic fits, or to ""a paroxysm of cataleptic insanity"".
